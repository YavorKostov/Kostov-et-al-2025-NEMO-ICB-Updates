Model code and input files for the simulations in Kostov et al. (2025) 
including code developed by Yavor Kostov to improve the iceberg dynamics
and grounding capability in NEMO.

The customizations of the model code are compatible with NEMO 4.2
Kostov updated the pressure gradient force, the ocean drag, 
sediment resistance, gravity and Coulomb friction along the solid basement, 
and introduced iceberg substepping.

The boundary conditions in all experiments are based on the JRA55-do atmospheric reanalysis (Tsujino et al., 2018), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2018.07.002.
